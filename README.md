# Unsellable-License-Condition

The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined below, subject to the following condition.

Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to sell the Software. “Sell” means provide the Software to third parties for a fee.

For example :

- Distributing the Software (e.g. over an app store) is permitted as long as it is for free.
- Receiving retribution for providing customer-support is permitted.
- Billing a customer for installing the Software is not permitted.
- Getting paid for dev work (refactoring, perf optim, evolutions...) on the Software is permitted.
- Selling in-app extensions is permitted.
- Removing core-app functionalities to sell them as extensions is not permitted.

Disclaimer : 

Applying this clause on modular source code might require rework, especially if your components are published as independent open source packages. To prevent such components from being included in a sellable copycat, one would need to re-insert them within the repositoriy where the clause applies.

Any license notice or attribution required by the License must also include this License Condition notice.
